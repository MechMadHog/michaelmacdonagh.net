# michaelmacdonagh.net

This is my **formal site**.

It exists to present finished work, skills, and background clearly and without distraction.
It is the place I would send a recruiter, a client, or anyone who needs a clean view of what I can do.

This site is intentionally restrained.

## What This Site Is

- A professional portfolio
- A record of completed and verifiable work
- A place for things that are finished enough to stand over

Content here is curated.
If something appears on this site, it has earned its place.

---

## What This Site Is Not

- A personal blog
- A playground for experiments
- A running log of thoughts or ideas

Those live elsewhere.

For personal work, experiments, and writing in progress, see:

## Standard

This site prioritises:
- clarity
- maintainability
- low noise

It is built conservatively on purpose.
The goal is not novelty.
The goal is reliability.

## Technical Notes

The site is built as a static project using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
Content is written in Markdown.
Dependencies are kept minimal.

The structure is simple so the site can be maintained for years without friction.
