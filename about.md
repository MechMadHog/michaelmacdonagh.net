          <p class="mb-3">
            I design and build small to medium digital systems, ranging from static websites to internal tools and automation workflows.
            My work includes front-end development, UI design, content systems, and lightweight back-end integrations.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            I have built and maintained WordPress sites for small businesses, internal tools for support and operations teams, and enterprise apps using the Microsoft Power Platform.
            In recent years, my focus has shifted toward open technologies and static, inspectable systems.

          <p class="mb-3">
            I work iteratively and ship often. Projects start small, get tested under real constraints, and are refined around what proves useful.

          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Full-Stack Transition</h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Since August, I have been working daily toward becoming a full-stack developer, with a stronger focus on open-source tools and modern web development.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            This work is structured around the freeCodeCamp curriculum and supported by continuous project builds, public repositories, and live demos.
            The shift is intentional. I am moving away from closed platforms and low-code environments toward systems I can inspect, extend, and maintain directly.

          <p class="mb-3">
            I began using AI tools in my workflows in 2023. This was encouraged early by my former manager as part of improving research, automation, and development efficiency.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            I treat AI as a support layer rather than a replacement for technical skill. I use it to accelerate exploration, documentation, and problem analysis.
