  <h2>How I Work</h2>
  <p>
    I prefer systems that are simple to understand, easy to maintain, and resilient under real-world conditions.
    I value clarity over cleverness and durability over novelty.
  </p>

  <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Front-end development and static site architecture</li>
    <li>Tools that reduce friction rather than introduce it</li>
    <li>Local-first and low-dependency workflows</li>
  </ul>
