  <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
  <p>
    I design and build small to medium digital systems, ranging from static websites to internal tools and automation workflows.
    My work includes front-end development, UI design, content systems, and lightweight back-end integrations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have built and maintained WordPress sites for small businesses, internal tools for support and operations teams, and enterprise apps using the Microsoft Power Platform.
    In recent years, my focus has shifted toward static, inspectable systems using modern web tooling.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Work</h2>
  <p>
    I work iteratively and ship often.
    Most projects start small, are pushed until something breaks, then rebuilt around what proved useful.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript for core interfaces</li>
    <li>Jekyll and GitHub Pages for static delivery</li>
    <li>Git for versioning and change tracking</li>
    <li>Docker and shell tooling for reproducible environments</li>
    <li>Automation and AI tools for workflow support</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Current Focus</h2>
  <p>
    My current work centres on building systems that are easy to understand, cheap to maintain, and resilient under real use.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Local-first tooling and offline workflows</li>
    <li>Static architectures with minimal dependencies</li>
    <li>Automation and small utilities that reduce friction</li>
    <li>AI-assisted research and knowledge systems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Full-Stack Transition</h2>
  <p>
    Since August, I have been working daily toward becoming a full-stack developer,
    with a stronger focus on open-source tools, static architectures, and local-first systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work is structured around the freeCodeCamp curriculum and supported by continuous
    project builds, public repositories, and live demos.
  </p>
  <p>
    The shift is intentional. I am moving away from closed platforms and low-code environments
    toward systems I can inspect, extend, and maintain directly.
  </p>

  <h2>Working with AI</h2>
  <p>
    I began using AI tools in my workflows in 2023.
    This was encouraged by my former manager as part of improving research, automation,
    and development efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, AI is treated as a support layer rather than a replacement for technical skill.
    I use it to accelerate exploration, documentation, and problem analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>Teaching and Community</h2>
  <p>
    I have volunteered as a <strong>CoderDojo mentor</strong>, teaching young people programming and digital skills.
    This work was recognised with a <strong>Special Purpose Certificate in Civic Engagement</strong> from <strong>ATU</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional Context</h2>
  <p>
    I have worked across freelance, client, and corporate environments.
    This includes long-term contracts, internal tooling, and public-facing systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am comfortable owning a project end to end, from initial problem definition and design through to delivery, documentation, and iteration.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional References</h2>
  <p>
    The following quotes are from colleagues and managers I have worked with.
    They are included as evidence of how I operate in team and delivery environments.
