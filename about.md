  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    My work spans small business websites, internal tools, and enterprise applications built on the Microsoft Power Platform.
    This has given me both creative range and experience working inside real technical and organisational constraints.
  </p>
  <p>
    I began in design and digital media, then moved into development through hands-on project work.
    Over time, I shifted away from marketing-driven platforms and low-code tools toward modern web development and open technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    To formalise that shift, I committed to completing the freeCodeCamp full-stack curriculum.
    This includes seven web-focused certifications and roughly 1,800 hours of project-based learning.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Direction</h2>
  <p>
    My current focus is on systems that behave well under real use and remain understandable when they need to be changed.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modern front-end development and static architectures</li>
    <li>Local-first and low-dependency workflows</li>
    <li>Automation and tooling that reduce cognitive load</li>
    <li>Building systems that can be inspected, maintained, and extended</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Teaching and Community</h2>
  <p>
    Alongside my own work, I volunteered for several years as a <strong>CoderDojo mentor</strong>, teaching young people programming and digital skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was awarded a <strong>Special Purpose Certificate in Civic Engagement</strong> from <strong>ATU</strong> for this work.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional Approach</h2>
  <p>
    I work across the full lifecycle of a project, from problem definition and design through to implementation, testing, and iteration.
    Clear communication and practical problem-solving are central to how I work.
