> tl;dr... Jekyll + a light formal theme, dark project cards for contrast, and simple data-driven JS for a filterable projects grid.

## Why a portfolio site (and not just LinkedIn)

- I needed a **formal, fast** place that shows work and thought process.
- Ownership: no plugin sprawl, no surprise updates.

## Two sites: formal vs. personal

- **This site**: formal, minimal, case-study friendly.
- **Personal site**: experiments, notes-to-self, and more opinionated posts.

## Choosing the color scheme

- Base: **white + greys** for a professional tone.
- Primary: **purple** (#6b4ad8) with **icy blue** accents for state/hover.
- Contrast: **near-black project cards** to make work samples pop.

## Pages & structure

- Home ‚Üí snapshot, competencies, selected work, latest posts.
- Projects ‚Üí tag filtering powered by a tiny JS file.
- Certifications ‚Üí FCC first; degree details collapsible.
- Blog ‚Üí featured on top, paginated list, categories/tags hubs.

## Stack & decisions

- **Jekyll**: Markdown + Git, zero DB, deploy anywhere.
- **Styling**: `_sass/_theme.scss` with brand tokens (purple/ice).
- **JS**: `/assets/js/main.js` populates cards + filter (with `?tag=‚Ä¶`).
- **Accessibility**: focus rings, readable muted text on white, keyboard filter controls.

## What I‚Äôll use the blog for

- Short write-ups on **support ops** and **documentation** patterns.
- Tiny front-end utilities and **automation** snippets.
- Transparent notes on what I change here over time.
